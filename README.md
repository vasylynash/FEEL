# FEEL

## The goal:

F.E.E.L (Find, Eat, Enjoy, Love) allows a user to search for a recipe based on cuisine preference and meal type; once the search populates the user can either read the text instruction or click the YouTube button to transport them to the collection of how-to videos.

## Technologies/frameworks: 
[Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/), JavaScript, jQuery.
APIs: [Edamam](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api), [YouTube](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list).

## Instructions: 
On the main page, type in your keyword in the search field, and click **Submit**. Optionally, you can choose **Meal Type** and **Cuisine Type** from the dropdown menus.

The search results with the recipes that match the keyword and selection will appear on the page.
Each recipe has **calories count**, **servings**, and **time to cook** fields, and a small image of the dish.

To see the ingredients needed for the meal, click the **Ingredients** button.
To see the text instructions for the recipe, click the recipe title.
To find videos on how to prepare the meal, click the **Find Videos** button.

The video results (10) will appear in a new tab. To see more search results on YouTube, click the **See more on YouTube** button.
